# IIS Express - Easy Launcher
**Launch IIS Express on any folder by right clicking**

IIS express launcher looks at the directory where it is launched, for a iisexpress.config file, and start iis express with it.

For easy access, can IIS Express Launcher be executed, from the context menu, when used on a directory.

If the IIS Express Launcher cant find an config, it creates it from a standard config, found in iis express install directory.
